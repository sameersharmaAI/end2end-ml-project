# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a modular and industry-level structure for machine learning applications. It includes custom logging and exception handling, and it integrates a Flask API with a web app written in html hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an AWS CodePipeline C/D Pipeline. The core functionality of the project is to predict students' math scores based on their attributes.

## Features

- Modular code structure following machine learning industry best practices.
- Custom logging and exception handling.
- Flask API serving as the backend for the web app.
- HTML-based frontend for user interaction.
- Integration with AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment and AWS CodePipeline C/D pipeline.

## Installation

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameersharmaAI/end2end.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd end2end
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictdata` to use the ML model.

## Usage

- **Local**: After running the application locally, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictdata` to interact with the ML model.
- **AWS Deployment**: (Currently down) The web app is also hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Access it via http://sp4-env.eba-umzqkpvp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/predictdata

## Data

The input data consists of student's scores and attributes. The model predicts their math score based on this data.

## Learning Resources

This project was developed as part of learning how to structure machine learning code and deploy it using modern tools. The primary resource used for learning was Krish Naik's YouTube tutorials.
